## üîí Security Vulnerability Analysis

This project includes automated security vulnerability analysis that runs on every repository push.

### Current Security Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues Found**: Weak random number generation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Priority**: Outdated dependencies (log4net, Newtonsoft.Json)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Priority**: Missing input validation

### Quick Security Scan
Run a local security scan before pushing:

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\scripts\security-scan.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./scripts/security-scan.sh
```

### Automated Analysis
- GitHub Actions workflow runs security scans on every push
- CodeQL static analysis for C# vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Custom security rule validation
- Automated report generation

### Documentation
- [Vulnerability Analysis Report](VULNERABILITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md) - Detailed security findings
- [Security Setup Guide](SECURITY_SETUP_GUIDE.md) - Complete setup instructions
- [Security Configuration](security-config.yml) - Security scanning configuration
